# FONDECYT Grant 11250039 - Interactive Narrative Analytics
This grant is funded by ANID (*Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo*) and the full title is **Interactive Narrative Analytics: Developing scalable knowledge-based narrative extraction models and visual analytics systems for sensemaking in complex information landscapes**.

**Disclaimer**: This project has been pre-selected by ANID under the *FONDECYT de Iniciación 2025* grants. Implementation will commence upon completion of all required administrative processes. This page is intended for informational and preliminary dissemination purposes only.

## Abstract
This project aims to advance the state-of-the-art in computational narrative extraction and interactive analytics to support sensemaking from large, complex collections of news articles. The rapid proliferation of online news and the increasing prevalence of misinformation and disinformation have made it ever more challenging and important for analysts and the public to make sense of the news landscape. Building on the PI's prior work on narrative maps and a theoretical foundation in narrative extraction and interactive visual analytics, this project will develop novel knowledge-informed models and scalable computational architectures to extract and interactively visualize the key entities, events, and storylines across large news corpora. Specifically, we will design and implement 1) **SCANIA** - a scalable system for interactive narrative analytics based on a novel combination of optimization algorithms, machine learning, and large language models, and 2) **KINUS** - a knowledge-informed narrative extraction model that incorporates external knowledge bases and detailed entity-event representations. We will also devise new metrics for evaluating the quality, coherence, and coverage of the extracted narratives. The methods will be evaluated both quantitatively using these metrics and qualitatively through case studies on real-world news datasets and expert feedback. The outcomes will include new empirical findings, computational models, evaluation metrics, and an interactive prototype system. More broadly, this work will provide analysts and society with advanced tools to understand the narratives shaping the news and combat the spread of misinformation. All the data and code will be made publicly available to support further research and development in this area.

## Main Issues and Goals
This project aims to develop scalable and knowledge-enhanced interactive narrative analytics techniques to support sensemaking from large collections of news articles. The main challenges addressed are:
- Scalability of narrative extraction to enable analysis of high-volume, dynamic news data.
- Integration of external knowledge to improve the completeness and coherence of extracted narratives.
- Evaluation of narrative quality in terms of coverage, consistency, and alignment with domain knowledge.

## Methodology
The project will progress through the following key phases:
- Design and implementation of SCANIA - a scalable computational framework for interactive narrative analytics. SCANIA will leverage optimization algorithms, machine learning, and large language models to efficiently extract narratives and enable real-time user interaction.
- Design and implementation of KINUS - a knowledge-informed narrative extraction model that incorporates external knowledge bases and detailed entity-event representations to construct semantically rich narratives.
- Development of new metrics to quantitatively evaluate narrative quality, coherence, and consistency with domain knowledge. Case studies and expert feedback will provide additional qualitative evaluation.
- Comparative analysis of the proposed methods against existing baseline narrative extraction methods on real-world news datasets from multiple domains.

## Expected Results
- Novel scalable and knowledge-informed computational models for interactive narrative analytics.
- Novel narrative evaluation metrics that capture quality, coherence, coverage and knowledge consistency.
- Prototype interactive narrative analytics system evaluated on real-world news data.
- Improved sensemaking of complex, dynamic news storylines to combat misinformation and information overload.
