I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computing and Systems Engineering at Universidad Católica del Norte in Antofagasta, Chile, where I also serve as Secretary of Research and Technological Development for the Faculty of Engineering and Geological Sciences.

I am the Director of the Artificial Intelligence Innovation Center for the Antofagasta Region project, funded by the regional government of Antofagasta. I have also been recently selected for a FONDECYT Initiation Grant to work on Interactive Narrative Analytics.

In general, my research encompasses visual analytics, artificial intelligence, text analytics, and computational narratives, with particular emphasis on developing interactive narrative maps using AI techniques. I also work in applied data science in different areas, including mining, geochemistry, and education.

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Applications at Virginia Tech in July 2023, which I started in 2019 with the support of the Fulbright Faculty Development program and Universidad Católica del Norte, alongside the government scholarship Becas Chile.
