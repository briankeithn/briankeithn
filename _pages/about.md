I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computing and Systems Engineering at Universidad Católica del Norte in Antofagasta, Chile. My research interests lie at the intersection of visualization, artificial intelligence, and computational narratives. However, I am also broadly interested in visual analytics, natural language processing, and data science. My current work focuses on the extraction and visualization of computational narratives using interactive narrative maps based on artificial intelligence techniques.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Applications from Virginia Tech in July 2023, which I started in 2019 with the support of the Fulbright Faculty Development program and Universidad Católica del Norte, alongside the government scholarship Becas Chile. Previously, I studied at Universidad Católica del Norte, where I obtained my master's degree in Informatics in 2017, a bachelor's degree in Mathematics in 2017, and a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering in Computing and Informatics in 2016.
